##  Overview

Wallhaven.py is a Python library designed to simplify interactions with the Wallhaven API. It provides a user-friendly interface for searching and retrieving high-resolution wallpapers, accessing user collections, and fetching random images. The library handles API requests, error handling, and JSON parsing, allowing developers to easily integrate Wallhavens vast library of wallpapers into their applications. Whether youre building a wallpaper management tool, a desktop background changer, or a creative project that requires high-quality imagery, Wallhaven.py offers a robust and efficient solution for accessing Wallhaven's extensive collection.

##  Features

|    |   Feature         | Description |
|----|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| ‚öôÔ∏è  | **Architecture**  | The project utilizes a class-based architecture with a `WallhavenPY` class encapsulating API interactions. It leverages external libraries for HTTP requests and JSON parsing. |
| üî© | **Code Quality**  | The codebase demonstrates good readability and follows Python conventions. It includes clear variable names and comments, enhancing maintainability. |
| üìÑ | **Documentation** | The repository includes basic documentation within the code itself, explaining the purpose of each file and key functions. However, more comprehensive documentation would be beneficial. |
| üîå | **Integrations**  | The project integrates with the Wallhaven API for retrieving wallpaper data. It utilizes external libraries like `requests` for HTTP requests and `urllib3` for secure communication. |
| üß© | **Modularity**    | The codebase is modular, with the `WallhavenPY` class encapsulating API interactions. This allows for easy reuse and extension of the functionality. |
| üß™ | **Testing**       | The project includes a test suite (`test_wallhaven.py`) that utilizes mocking to validate API interactions and error handling. |
| ‚ö°Ô∏è  | **Performance**   | The project's performance is likely dependent on the Wallhaven API's response time and network conditions. The codebase itself appears optimized for efficient API interactions. |
| üõ°Ô∏è | **Security**      | The project relies on the security measures provided by the `urllib3` library for secure communication. However, it's important to note that the API key should be handled securely to prevent unauthorized access. |
| üì¶ | **Dependencies**  | Key dependencies include `requests`, `urllib3`, `certifi`, `idna`, and `charset-normalizer`. These libraries provide essential functionalities for HTTP requests, secure communication, and character encoding. |
| üöÄ | **Scalability**   | The project's scalability depends on the Wallhaven API's rate limits and the ability to handle increased traffic. The codebase itself appears well-structured for potential future scaling. |

##  Modules

<details closed><summary>.</summary>

| File | Summary |
| --- | --- |
| errors.py | The `errors.py` file defines a custom exception class named `WallhavenAPIError`. This exception is used to handle errors that occur when interacting with the Wallhaven API, providing a clear and specific way to manage API-related issues within the repositorys architecture. |
| requirements.txt | The `requirements.txt` file specifies the external Python libraries necessary for the Wallhaven API client to function correctly. These libraries provide essential functionalities like HTTP requests, URL parsing, and secure communication, enabling the client to interact with the Wallhaven API effectively. |
| test_wallhaven.py | This test suite thoroughly validates the functionality of the WallhavenPY class, ensuring its ability to handle successful API requests, various error scenarios, and specific search operations. It leverages mocking to simulate API responses and exceptions, guaranteeing robust and reliable interactions with the Wallhaven API. |
| usage.py | The `usage.py` file demonstrates the basic usage of the `WallhavenPY` class within the `wallhaven.py` repository. It showcases how to initialize the client, retrieve collections data, and perform searches with various parameters. |
| wallhaven.py | The `wallhaven.py` file provides a Python client for interacting with the Wallhaven API. It offers methods for searching wallpapers, retrieving wallpaper details, accessing user collections, and fetching random wallpapers. The client handles API requests, error handling, and JSON parsing, simplifying interactions with the Wallhaven API. |
